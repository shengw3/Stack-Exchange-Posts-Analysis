# Stack-Exchange-Posts-Analysis
Summer 2019 STATS project

We used the data given by instructor to analyze stack exchange posts. 

We used both linear and logistic regression to make predictions on both question dataset and answer dataset. 
We also used text mining and visualization to see if questions with certain words are more likely to be answered. 

This is a team project with Chloe, Haritha. For more information, please refer to the project report.
